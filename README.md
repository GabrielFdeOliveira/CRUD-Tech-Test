# CRUD-Tech-Test
This full-stack application boasts advanced CRUD functionality, powered by a combination of Node.js, Express, PG, and Jest for the backend and Next.JS for the frontend. With these cutting-edge technologies, the application provides a seamless and efficient user experience.

# Assignment
Developer Coding Test
We would like you to create a web application that produces some kind of user management functionality. The application should be able to:

Display the users in a list/table.
Have the ability to create users.
Have the ability to update users.
Have the ability to delete users. The task gives you free rain on how the front end of the application will look, but it is important to note that it should mainly focus on producing a good working solution.
Build this using:

Use either C# .Net Core or Node.js as backend implementations via a RESTful API.
Use any frontend implementation that you feel most comfortable with. (Vanilla JavaScript, React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, Angular are all fine examples that you could use :)).
Data driven from a JSON file or a MongoDB/SQL database
Share your work:

Set up a repository on Github or BitBucket to host your code so we can pull down the code from there.
If you are using a database please ensure a copy of it in the repo so we can use and run your application
Please share any development/set up notes in a README.md
Bits of advice:

Don’t spend too much time on the frontend look and feel. We would like you to spend most of your time on the functionality and ensuring that code is clean, error handled well and working as it should.
These coding challenges can be very time consuming so we wouldn’t expect you to do any more than half a day on it. Not focusing too much on the styling should save you time.
Have fun with it, and feel free to add your own touches or extra features (but again only if time allows)
